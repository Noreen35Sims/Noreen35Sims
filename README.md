## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a backend developer with a strong focus on building clean, scalable, and efficient systems. Lately, Iâ€™ve been working extensively with Prisma and PostgreSQL for database modeling and backend logic, and this repository is part of that ongoing journey.

Iâ€™m particularly interested in designing robust data structures and APIs that can support complex applications. Prisma has become my go-to ORM thanks to its type safety, intuitive schema modeling, and seamless integration with modern JavaScript/TypeScript stacks. Combined with the power and reliability of PostgreSQL, it's a setup that allows me to move quickly without compromising on performance or clarity.

This repository showcases my exploration of various backend concepts using Prisma and PostgreSQLâ€”whether it's advanced relational modeling, migrations, seed scripts, or API integrations. Youâ€™ll also find patterns and best practices I've picked up along the way, from structuring projects to managing data consistency and optimizing queries.

For me, backend development is not just about codeâ€”itâ€™s about crafting a solid foundation that applications can rely on. Iâ€™m constantly looking for ways to write better, cleaner, and more maintainable backend logic. Each project here reflects real-world scenarios or challenges I've encountered and how I approached solving them.

If you're working with Prisma or PostgreSQLâ€”or just diving into backend developmentâ€”I hope you find something helpful or interesting in this repository. Feedback, questions, and collaboration are always welcome. Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy building! ðŸš€
